      <p>Anvil Hack - the student-run hackathon at Goldsmiths, Unviersity of London - is back for the fourth time! Our hackathon is focussed on the creative applications of technology taking place at a centre of creative computing research.</p>
      <p>Use your skills to make something wonderful, arty, musical - anything you build will be awesome. We'll provide you with food, drink, electricity and internet, so that you can get on with the real work - making cool things!</p>
      <p>We have the privilege of sharing our fabrication lab with you, built right into the church. You'll have access to state of the art equipment to build awesome physical computing projects. Exciting!</p>
